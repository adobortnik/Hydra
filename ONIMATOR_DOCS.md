## Human Behaviour Emulation

**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025

### Overview
Human Behaviour Emulation makes Onimator actions look more natural by simulating how real people use Instagram. Instead of only direct actions, the app behaves like a real user by:
- Watching Stories
- Scrolling the Home Feed
- Browsing the Explore Page

Enable one, two, or all three features. Using all three provides the most human-like behavior.

### How It Works
When enabled, Onimator randomly performs these actions within your defined limits:
- Varies watch time
- Randomizes delays
- Randomly likes content based on percentage

### Watch Home Feed Stories Action

**Stories to Watch per Operation:**
- Minimum Reels to Watch
- Maximum Reels to Watch
- Randomly selects between min and max

**Watch Seconds per Story:**
- Minimum/Maximum seconds per story
- Each story gets random watch duration

**Percent to Like Story:**
- Percentage chance a watched story gets liked
- 50% = roughly half liked, 0% = watch only, 100% = like all

**Best Use Case:** Warming up new/aged accounts, natural daily activity, trust score improvement.

### Scroll Home Feed Action

**Scroll Feed per Operation:**
- Min/Max posts to scroll through

**Delays after Scroll:**
- Min/Max pause after scrolling a post (simulates reading)

**Percent to Like Post:**
- Chance a scrolled post gets liked (30–50% = realistic)

**Best Use Case:** Normal daily engagement, preventing action-only patterns, organic sessions.

### Scroll Explore Page Action

**Scroll Explore Page Post per Operation:**
- Min/Max Explore posts to scroll

**Delays after Post:**
- Min/Max pause per post

**Percent to Like Post:**
- Recommended: Lower than Home Feed

**Best Use Case:** Discover-like behavior, new account warming, curiosity-based scrolling.

### Recommended Setup (Safe & Natural)
- Enable all three features
- Percent to like: 30–60%
- Small delays: 3–7 seconds
- Avoid setting all values to maximum

### Important Notes
- These features do NOT replace core actions (follow, unfollow, etc.)
- They support account safety and realism
- More features enabled = more natural behavior
